## 🧾 How It Works

Users can create an account, which gets stored in a MySQL database.

After login, users can access a menu with options like withdraw, deposit, and check balance.

Every operation updates the database in real-time.

The session ends when the user chooses Exit.

## 🔒 Security Notes

PINs should ideally be hashed for real-world use.
